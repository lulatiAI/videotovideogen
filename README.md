🎥 AI Video-to-Video Generator

Transform existing videos into AI-enhanced versions with just a few clicks. This project powers the Video-to-Video page on Lulati.com
, allowing users to upload videos and receive high-quality AI-transformed results instantly.

🚀 Features

Video-to-Video Transformation: Users can submit a source video, and AI generates an enhanced or stylized video automatically.

Cloud Storage: Uploaded videos and generated outputs are securely stored in Amazon S3 for reliable access.

Content Moderation: All videos are screened automatically using AWS Rekognition and Lambda to ensure safe, appropriate content.

AI Processing: Videos are processed using RunwayML’s advanced models (currently Gen 4 Aleph) for high-quality, realistic transformations.

Real-Time Feedback: Users receive status updates during the upload, moderation, and generation processes.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

Future-Ready: Designed to integrate Stripe for monetization, support multiple AI models, and eventually become a mobile application.

🛠️ How It Works

Upload a Video: Users submit a video from their device.

Moderation Check: The system automatically reviews the video content using AWS Rekognition and Lambda.

AI Video Generation: If approved, the AI processes the video using RunwayML’s Gen 4 Aleph model to generate a transformed version.

Cloud Storage: The generated video is stored securely in Amazon S3.

Delivery: Users can preview and download their AI-enhanced video.

Progress Tracking: Users can see the status of each stage and track logs in real time.
